		<p> Today I attempted and landed a 50-50 on a circle rail. It was scary and I don't think i would've done it if I didnt watch the nine club <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3LUnPO5OI&t=4779s">Bastien Salabanzi</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aqmjl5NxhH0"> Nyjah Huston </a> interviews the past couple days. </p>
		<p>They both shared stories of why when they go for rails, (or any scary trick) that you have to commit 100%. Any shred of doubt you have rolling up, or mid pop will only increase the chance of injury.</p>
		<p> Nyjah shared that injuries only happen when he doesnt fully commit. And Bastien told a story of watching Tom Penny only commiting 100%, even when the board wasnt fully there.
		<p>Today I never commited 100%, even the one I landed Im pretty sure I closed my eyes on the rail and got lucky. I was so worried that my body weight wouldnt be on right, my trucks would be crooked, and that everything could go wrong.Not commiting 100% was so scary i got jelly legs after landing it. Im happy i didnt get injured but i know i could have. Nyjahs and bastiens advice really sunk in after that.</p>

		<h2> How do you commit to rails? </h2>
		<p> <strong>believe</strong> that if you commit, you can land it. Empty your mind of everything else </p>

			Have you ever been super excited to skate all day, planning and waiting, then you get to the spot or the park and you really just don't want to skate? <br>
		</p>

		<p> 
			That happened to me today, it was a ledgendary spot too. When i got there i was so hyped, but my legs wouldnt work, and motivation quickly fled. I tried having a nap, doing a warm up routine, and tricking myself to think that im full of energy to skate. But i couldnt beat this heavy, gloomy feeling. <br>
		</p>

		<p> 
		It was the worst going to a spot, not being able to skate, and not knowing why. Im still kinda torn about it. <br>
		</p>

		<p> 
		And i wish i couldve done some more slappy grinds, they seemed fun.
		</p>

		<h2> How do you be happy every skate? </h2>
		<p> be happy with an ollie, be happy with rolling around. Cause one day, even that might not be possible.</p>

			<strong> change it up! </strong>
		</p>

		<p> 
			Today I skated a manny pad in a reserve alone and i had fun, skated heaps, and got some tricks. 
			After lunch I went and skated this footpath flatground spot. I was not feeling it at all but I was too scared to try skate anywhere else during level 3 isolation. 
			I ended up trying to skate but mostly sitting down alot.
			When I left I saw Hans and we had a 5 minute skate at this other open spot. I started having so much fun like straight away, got heaps of energy and was landing tricks. 
		</p>

		<p>
			To get in the zone you have to have fun. Its ok not to find every spot fun, you can always move on and find another :)

			<strong> Find a squad </strong>
		</p>

		<p> 
			I watched the japan 2019 world series and everyone there is on a completely different level. And they all skate together. If you skated with people who all pushed their limits to that level, you would grow at an insane amount.
		</p>

		<p> 
			you can get really far on your own. But skating with a squad will take you to new heights

			<strong> Enjoy whats happening now, as much as you can </strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			Today I went and skated a basketball court, had a real mean solo skate. Then biked around kinda aimlessly, not eagerly searching for anything, but real happy with just biking. I ended up finding a school, seeing a mate having a mean skate sesh! It all came out of no where, i didnt expect that to happen at all.  
		</p>

		<p> 
			I think by really enjoying whatever is happening NOW, you allow greater opportunities to flow into your life.

			<strong> Slowly build up momentum</strong>
		</p>

    <p>
      Today I went and skated a basketball court solo, I was having an allgood sesh then after about an hour i started to fade out and ended up just sitting down.
      I was about to leave when i saw the curb was double the height of an average curb around the whole park, so i tried like 180 50-50, it felt really good, so i tried 180 5-0 and that felt real good too. 
      Then i kept <strong> thinking of tricks </strong> i could do <strong>that would feel good to do.</strong>
      And before I knew it, I was in flow state hard, I had heaps of energy, and I was having heaps of fun. 
		</p>

    <p> 
      I think by starting off small, doing little tricks that feel good to do, then slowly building up from there is like a gateway to energy and fun. I hope you can always have a fun skate.

			<strong>Enjoy rolling on your board</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p> 
      Today i saw a little kid have so much fun just riding around on his board. He was smiling and going hard. While I was sitting down, not very motivated to skate hard at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      No matter how you are feeling, just rolling around and really feeling the board, and the ground. You cant not have fun, and when you start to really enjoy rolling around, well with me I instinctively start challenging myself. By carving, ollieing around, doing small challenges, winning, i felt really good and was having heaps of fun before i knew it. I kept challenging myself more and more and i wound up doing nollie gazelles! After not havinig the energy to even kickflip.
    </p>
    
    <h3> Summary </h3>
    <p>
    If you feel unmotivated and are sitting down while out skating.
    Do this to have fun, get energy, and start flowing!
    </p>


    <ol>
      <li> Roll around </li>
      <li> Feel the board, feel the ground </li>
      <li> Let your mind wander </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      You should instinctively start to challenge yourself, looking for ways to up the anti by adding ollies or carving etc. 
     <br> From there let the momentum take you!
     <br> I hope you can always have a fun and productive skate!

			<strong> let go of the desired outcome </strong>
		</p>

    <p>
      I really wanted to make $80 doing uber eats today..
      Rent is due next week and I need to make some money now!
      Today I went out and worked from 12 for a couple of hours, only managing to make $15. When I went out for the night shift I was ready to go hard and put my all in to make as much money as i could, CAUSE I HAD TO.
      I was so worried about not paying rent that every corner i turned i was questioning whether this would lead me to more money then that street. 
      At one point I was halfway between 2 towns and I couldnt decide where to go, my heart was racing and i was low key freaking out because i didnt know which way would be more successfull.
      Then the uber gods looked down on me and gave me an order from one of the towns so i didnt have to choose.
      After that i didnt know where to go again, but instead of stressing out, I just sat down and had a snack cause i felt like it. 
      <strong>As soon as i finished eating</strong> i got an order from the shop across from me. Then i did the same thing and got an order straight away, and again. 
      It felt like everything was falling into place and i wasnt fighting it.
		</p>

    <p> 
      By eating and chilling, I put myself in a position where i wasnt worried about anything. I was eating snacks, and just enjoying that.
      By not worrying about rent or money, I felt calm, more positive and i really believe that allowed for more orders to come through, and for all the pieces to start dropping in place.
      I was happy, and fully trusting the unverse.
    </p>

    <h3> Summary </h3>
    <p>
    If you're stressing out while trying to complete something and nothing is working. Then follow these steps to allow things to flow and fall into place.
    </p>


    <ol>
      <li> Do something that makes you feel relaxed </li>
      <li> expect NOTHING </li>
      <li> have fun and let your instincts take over</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      I hope you can use this to help your rough days run abit smoother. later g

    To help others, to help yourself, to progress your skills, your career, make more income, be happy, present and balanced.
    You need to  <strong> Solve your own problems. </strong>
    And they dont have to be serious ones, actually, the funner the better.
    </p>

    <p>
      By finding solving one of your own problems: <br>
      The project automatically becomes funner and more interesting.
      You don't need to worry about validating it with user research cause you are the primary user.
      And you are <strong>100 times more likely to complete it </strong> because it will be something you enjoy.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've been pretty anxious about what I should be working on lately. Especially the last few days, I've learned so much on finding problems, niching down, growing an audience with the ultimate goal of being happy.
      But I found myself <strong> not being happy </strong> haha, I wanted to take the best course of action and I got stuck in the future, hard.
      So i just let go and asked myself "whats the funnest thing I can work on". And I did that, without knowing it I was solving a problem for a very specific niche (myself) and I was super motivated to get working on it.
      I spent all day coding, there were so many hurdles, but I had fun.<strong> I had fricken heaps of fun!! </strong>
      (The project was making an app where you can record and send you fart to your loved ones)  
    </p>

    <h3>Marketing your project</h3>
    
    <p>
      Sell your project to the yourself that had the problem. You are the primary user,
      because you are unique, youve created your own niche, now use your marketing skills to hone in!
